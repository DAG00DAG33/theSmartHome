This project is a smart light switch. It has the arduino code for an ESP8266 to controll my bedroom lights though internet, with the MQTT protocol. It constrolls the lights with some reles.

Also, I have done a CAD dessign so it fits well in the switch hole (european standar), holds the PCB, and covers the high power cables.
